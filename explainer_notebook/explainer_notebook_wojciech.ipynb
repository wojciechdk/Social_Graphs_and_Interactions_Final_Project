    "To start off, we needed to choose which WikiPedia data to use. Initially, we took all the pages that were below the category [Drugs by psychological effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Drugs_by_psychological_effects), and manually removed irrelevant pages and sub-categories. We mainly removed:\n",

    "- Everything under categories that cannot realistically be considered nootropics, such as [Psychedelic Drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Psychedelic_drugs)\n",
    "- Pages and categories that were not about specific substances - such as [Songs about Tobacco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Songs_about_tobacco)\n",
    "- Pages about __types__ of substances - such as [Stimulant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant). We only want to include substances - not *types of substances*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This part was very tedious and manual, and there was really nothing interesting about it - so we won't include code here. If you are interested, notes are in [TODO - LINK NOTEBOOK], You can also look at the resulting category tree [here](https://github.com/wojciechdk/Social_Graphs_and_Interactions_Final_Project/blob/master/shared_data/full_category_tree_clean.json).\n",
