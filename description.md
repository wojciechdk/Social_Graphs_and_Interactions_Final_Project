# Introduction

Nootropics are psychoactive substances, or drugs, that are used to improve cognitive performance in one way or another. They range from unregulated and widely used substances like caffeine, which is the most popular nootropic worldwide, to well-studied but heavily regulated drugs like ritaline, to new and highly experimental compounds of which little is known.

We are interested in looking at usage patterns of nootropics, and will do so in two main way:

1. First, we will build a network of nootropics that co-occur most often on wikipedia, much like we did for comics characters. This will likely provide insights on the "scientific" network of nootropics: we expect that communities will reflect substances that have similar chemical or biological roles.
(2. Then, using the substances identified in 1., we will this time build a graph based on substances that are mentionned together in online forums dedicated to nootropics. This network will let us look at *usage* patterns, and see which substances are most often used together.)

Depending on time availability, some extra interesting information could be extracted: 

- View how the networks (especially 2) evolve over time
- Look not only at nootropics but also at common collocations (words used together with them), which would give insights on the effects that are most commonly associated with them. 
- Do some sentiment analysis of the texts surrounding the use of nootropics in (2), to get a crude idea of which nootropics are associated with the most "positive" experiences.
